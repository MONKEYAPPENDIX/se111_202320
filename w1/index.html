        <p style="border: 1px solid green"> Hello my <U>name</U> is Raymond and i live in north kingstown. Currently I am enrolled at <b>NEIT</b>. I am working towards my <i>pilots</i> licence on the side
            I have two cats named <strong>Lilly</strong> and <em>Lola</em>. I am very excited fo this quarter due to it leading in the spring.
            I also enjoy walking as it gives me time to breath and think. Being a life long Rhoade Islander I <b>love</b> going to the beach and its one of my favorite parts of the summer.
            This is my third quarter at NEIT. I have been enjoying the cyber cicurity program a lot.
