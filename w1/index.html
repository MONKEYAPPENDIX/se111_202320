            I have two cats named <strong>Lilly</strong> and <em>Lo</em> I am very excited fo this quarter due to itending in the spring.
            I also enjoy walking as it gives me time to breath and think. being a Rhoade Islander I <b>love</b> going to the beach and its one of my favorite parts of the summer.
            this is my third quarer at NEIT. I used the summer sesion to get a bunch of my GE classes out of the way. I have been enjoying the cyber cicurity program a lot.
