                <p> Personally I love this movie and the way it is able to tell such a fantasic story about family and coming of age.
                    I think this is Steve Carells best on screen preformance. its not often we see him as the antagonist but in this movie he really sold the role.
                    It was filemd in massachusetts which makes it even better being able to recognize all of the scenery and loctaions that were shown in the film. I belive this added to my rating because knowing the scenery allowed me to focus just on the preformacne of the characters.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The story was by far my favorite aspect of the film as it was so well played out and never felt like the foucs moved away from Duncan and their was never a B plot that overcaptived my attention.
                    Throughout the plot the actors were able to portray the emotions in a very natural way.
                    It didn't feel over acted or under acted and held a close engagement with the viewer.
                    Overall for a movie made with the budget and size of this one it far surpassed my expectations and became my favorite movie.
                </p>
